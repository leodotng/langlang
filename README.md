LangLang takes a users's input from the search field and translates it into 9 different languages. The translated word is then captured by text to Speech technology that speaks the word in the corresponding accent voice. Furthermore, a photo API is accessed to display a matching photo for memory help. One push of a button allows the word a user inputs to be spoken in all 9 languages sequentially.
