## LangLang the Loris helps you learn lots of languages at the same time!

Story behind LangLang:
My mother in law didn't speak english when I first met her. I knew I was going to have to learn Spanish if I ever wanted to get to know her and the rest of the family. I didn't need any books or tutorials, by speaking the language, and using it, I learned it very quickly. I am no where near fluent in Spanish but there are too many languages and too many places in the world to to go see to have to choose one language. LangLang helps people learn many languages at the same time.

LangLang takes a users's input from the search field and translates it into 9 different languages. The translated word is then captured by text to Speech technology that speaks the word in the corresponding accent voice. Furthermore, a photo API is accessed to display a matching photo for memory help. One push of a button allows the word a user inputs to be spoken in all 9 languages sequentially.
